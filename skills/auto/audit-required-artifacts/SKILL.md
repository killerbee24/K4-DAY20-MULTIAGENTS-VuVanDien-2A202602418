description: Use this after implementing changes to confirm all required documentation and test artifacts are complete and correct.
---
1. Extract all artifact requirements from the task rules (e.g., "CHANGELOG.md with 3+ bullets", "tests/test_regressions.py with one test per bug fixed").
2. For each artifact, verify:
   - File exists and is in the correct location.
   - Content matches the required format and structure (e.g., bullet format, function naming, metadata fields).
   - Quantity requirements are met (e.g., "at least 3" entries or tests).
3. If a required artifact is missing or incomplete, create or update it.
4. Run a final check: execute any tests that must pass, parse any metadata to confirm structure.
5. Completion check: All required artifacts exist, are correctly formatted, and pass validation.
